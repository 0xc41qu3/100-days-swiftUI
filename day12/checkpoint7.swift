/**
 Checkpoint 7
 ‚Ä¢ Make a class hierarchy for animals.
 ‚Ä¢ Start with Animal. Add a legs property for the number of legs an animal has.
 ‚Ä¢ Make Dog a subclass of Animal, giving it a speak method that prints a dog barking string, but each subclass should print something different.
 ‚Ä¢ Make Corgi and Poodle subclasses of Dog.
 ‚Ä¢ Make Cat an Animal subclass. Add a speak method, with each subclass printing something different, and an `isTame` Boolean, set with an initializer.
 ‚Ä¢ Make Persian and Lion as subclasses of Cat.
